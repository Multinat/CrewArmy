# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Git Command Policy - CRITICAL RULE
**NEVER execute git commands on behalf of the user. ALWAYS print git commands for manual application.**

### What I will do:
- Print git commands as text output for copy-paste
- Provide clear, copy-paste ready commands
- Include descriptive commit messages
- Suggest appropriate git workflows
- ALWAYS provide complete command sequences
- NEVER include .cursorrules file in git commits or pushes

### What I will NEVER do:
- Execute `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git diff`, or any git commands
- Run terminal commands that modify the repository
- Automatically stage, commit, or push changes
- Assume control over version control operations
- Use run_terminal_cmd for git operations

### Example of correct behavior:
Always provide git commands in this exact format with comments:

```bash
# Add the modified files (excluding .cursorrules)
git add app/app/pages/12/page.tsx README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Update page 12 header spacing

- Doubled desktop padding from md:py-8 to md:py-16
- Doubled desktop padding from lg:py-12 to lg:py-24
- Doubled desktop margin from md:mt-8 to md:mt-16
- Doubled desktop margin from lg:mt-12 to lg:mt-24
- Mobile padding unchanged to preserve mobile rendering"

# Push to the main branch
git push origin main
```

## General Development Guidelines
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- **NEVER make any adjustments or changes to any mobile page, unless specifically asked for**
- Maintain mobile rendering exactly as-is when making desktop changes
- Use Page 12 as the desktop standard template for header spacing
- Focus on desktop browser menu overlap issues only
- Do not alter page layouts unless specifically requested
- Preserve all existing functionality and styling

## Communication Style
- Do not apologize unnecessarily
- Continue directly with answers
- Be concise and action-oriented
- Provide clear, actionable instructions

This rule is permanently established and must be followed in all interactions.

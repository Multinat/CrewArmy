# Slide 7

Objective: Present the VPO implementation framework showing the methods and enablers that will support the Crew Army team in achieving autonomous operations excellence.

Layout Composition:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to content, a main body that grows to fill the remaining space, and a footer sized to content. The main body is a grid with two rows (auto 1fr). The top row contains the method overview, and the bottom row is a grid with three columns (1fr 1fr 1fr) for the three main enabler categories.

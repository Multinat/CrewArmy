# Slide 1

Objective: Create an impactful title slide that establishes the presentation's purpose and energizes the Crew Army team with the transformation vision.

Layout Composition:
The slide is a single flex-col container that fills the entire viewport, with all content centered both horizontally and vertically. The layout uses three main sections: a top section sized to content for the main title, a middle section that grows to fill available space containing the subtitle and tagline, and a bottom section sized to content for the year identifier.

# Image Requirements Summary

After analyzing all 9 slides in the presentation, **no images are required**.

## Rationale

This presentation is focused on operational strategy, roles, responsibilities, and implementation frameworks for manufacturing teams. The content is primarily:

- Strategic frameworks and methodologies
- Role definitions and responsibilities  
- Performance metrics and KPIs
- Implementation timelines and processes

The VPO wheel visualization mentioned in Slide 2 will be created through code-based graphics rather than requiring an external image, as it's a custom dashboard component with specific data points and interactive elements.

The presentation achieves its objectives through:
- Clear text-based content organization
- Color-coded sections for the four VPO areas
- Icon usage for visual enhancement
- Card-based layouts for information hierarchy

All visual elements needed (icons, color coding, layout structure) are achieved through the CSS/component design rather than requiring informational photographs or illustrations.

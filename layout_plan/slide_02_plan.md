Objective: Present the VPO (Value-Performance-Operations) wheel as the central framework showing how the four operational areas interconnect to drive autonomous team success.

Layout Composition:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to content, a main body that grows to fill the remaining space, and a footer sized to content. The main body is a flex-row with two sections: a left panel (2fr) containing the VPO wheel visualization and a right panel (1fr) containing the overview information.
